The application makes use of 2 JSON files to store data. These files are called students.json and teachers.json. The format of these files is as follows:

```json
{
    "students.json": [
        {
            "first_name": "John",
            "last_name": "Doe",
            "grade": 9,
            "id": 123456,
            "number_plate" : "ABC123",
            "call_status" : "0"
        }
    ]
}
```
```json
{
    "teachers.json": [
        {
            "username": "teacher1",
            "password": 123456
        }
